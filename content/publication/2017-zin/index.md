abstract: This paper discusses the challenges of creating a theoretic framework within the context of an intercultural and ethically responsible knowledge organization system (KOS). First, the paper explores ethical and societal concerns linked to the development of KOS. Second, it illustrates a way to tackle this ethical factor by proposing an applicable architecture for intercultural interfaces which respects cultural diversity on a global scale. The author emphasizes the importance of opening up the notion of cultural inclusiveness, to weigh not only linguistic diversity but also other cultural and social aspects, such as geography, religious affiliations, tradition, historical elements, ethnic. This kind of approach should be attentive to intersectionality and cultural interoperability.
