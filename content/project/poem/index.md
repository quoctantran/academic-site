Within the POEM’s context, the concept of participatory memory work is used as a conceptual frame to examine the inclusion of diverse types of memories into institutional memory and heritage building. As part of the Work Package 3 (‘Connectivities built by memory modalities’), my research takes a closer look on digital infrastructures in European memory institutions, questioning their ability to facilitate participatory approaches and create social inclusiveness. The research project has two objectives:

1. Investigate the qualities that digital infrastructures need to support and facilitate participatory memory work
2. Assess the socially inclusive potentials of digital memory modalities: whether they reflect the institution’s commitment to user engagement and social inclusion
